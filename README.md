# cpp-files
where all of my cpp files
r located.
basically a mini cloud

you can ignore this repository if you want but if you want to see my code, \n you can, it's just not really good yet.

### stats
i use visual studio code and i use this github as a cloud between my devices \n so i don't have to constantly email myself 1600 times.
